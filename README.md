## About

### FireBase
Firebase Firestore & Storage for CRUD and file uploads. Animated loops enhanced blog data display. Fixed arrays maintained data consistency during form uploads. APIs populated the project with external data. Overall, this resulted in streamlined data management, dynamic visuals, and seamless integration with external sources. 
### GSAP
GSAP along with ScrollTrigger & Locomotive Animation library to create captivating animations. Drawing inspiration from my own creativity, I designed unique animations throughout the website, starting from an explosive egg animation on the page. I incorporated various other stunning animations to enhance the user experience, dynamic website.
### Angular
I tackled the challenge of Integrating Firebase and animations into an Angular app. I developed a full-fledged app that smoothly retrieves dynamic data from a database. Although my project is a work in progress and not perfect, I continuously strive to enhance the website and learn over time, gaining valuable experience and improving my skills.
